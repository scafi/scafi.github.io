# Background

## Introduction: Aggregate Programming

Aggregate Programming
is a paradigm
for the development of _collective adaptive systems (CAS)_.
It provides a compositional, functional programming model
 for expressing the self-organising behaviour of a CAS
 by a global perspective.
Aggregate Computing (AC) is formally grounded in the _field calculus (FC)_,
 a minimal core language that captures the key mechanisms
 for bridging local and global behaviour.
FC is based on the notion of a _(computational) field_,
 a (possibly dynamic) map from a (possibly dynamic) domain of devices to computational values.

Aggregate Computing is based on a logical model that can be mapped diversely onto physical infrastructure.

* From a structural point of view,
 an aggregate system is merely a graph or network of devices (also called: nodes, agents, robots).
The edges connecting nodes represent logical communication channels
 that are set up by the aggregate computing platform
 according to an application-specific _neighbouring relationship_
 (which, for situated system, is typically a communication range).
* From a behavioural point of view,
 any device continuously interprets the aggregate program
 against its local context.
* From an interactional point of view,
 any device continuously interacts with its neighbours
 to acquire and propagate context.
 This is what enables local activity to influence global activity and viceversa.

### Execution model

In practice, devices sustain the aggregate computation
 through _asynchronous rounds_ which conceptually consist of the following steps:

1. _Context update_: the device retrieves previous state, environment data (through sensors), and messages from neighbours.
2. _Aggregate program execution_: the field computation is executed against the local context; this yields an *output*.
3. _Export broadcasting to neighbours_: from the output, a subset of data (called an _export_) for neighbour coordination can be automatically derived;
 the export has to be broadcast to the entire neighbourhood.
4. _Execute actuators_: the output of the program can describe a set of actuations to be performed on the environment.

A code example of round execution in ScaFi is shown in <a href="#building-aggregate-systems">Building Aggregate Systems</a>.

# ScaFi User Manual

## Hello, ScaFi

* Consider the following repository: [https://github.com/scafi/hello-scafi](https://github.com/scafi/hello-scafi)

As another example, consider the following steps.

**Step 1:** Add the dependency to scafi in your project (e.g., via sbt)

**Step 1-A:** SBT

{% highlight scala %}
val scafi_core  = "it.unibo.scafi" %% "scafi-core"  % "0.3.3"
val scafi_simulator_gui  = "it.unibo.scafi" %% "scafi-simulator-gui"  % "0.3.3"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(scafi_core, scafi_simulator_gui)
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 1-B:** GRADLE (`build.gradle.kts`)

{% highlight kotlin %}
plugins {
    java
    scala
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.12.2")
    implementation("it.unibo.scafi:scafi-core_2.12:0.3.3")
    implementation("it.unibo.scafi:scafi-simulator-gui_2.12:0.3.3")
    // Note: before ScaFi 0.3.3, the group ID was 'it.unibo.apice.scafiteam'
}

// the following may be needed when running using Java 11
tasks.withType<ScalaCompile> {
    sourceCompatibility = "1.8"
    targetCompatibility = "1.8"
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 2:** Use the API (e.g., to set up a simple simulation)

**Step 2-1:** Import or define an incarnation (a family of types),
from which you can import types like `AggregateProgram`

{% highlight scala %}
package experiments

// Method #1: Use an incarnation which is already defined
import it.unibo.scafi.incarnations.BasicSimulationIncarnation.AggregateProgram

// Method #2: Define a custom incarnation and import stuff from it
object MyIncarnation extends it.unibo.scafi.incarnations.BasicAbstractIncarnation
import MyIncarnation._
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 2-2:** Define an `AggregateProgram` which expresses the global behaviour of an ensemble.

{% highlight scala %}
// An "aggregate program" can be seen as a function from a Context to an Export
// The Context is the input for a local computation: includes state
//  from previous computations, sensor data, and exports from neighbours.
// The export is a tree-like data structure that contains all the information needed
//  for coordinating with neighbours. It also contains the output of the computation.
object MyAggregateProgram extends AggregateProgram {
  // Main program expression driving the ensemble
  // This is run in a loop for each agent
  // According to this expression, coordination messages are automatically generated
  // The platform/middleware/simulator is responsible for coordination
  override def main() = gradient(isSource)

  // The gradient is the (self-adaptive) field of the minimum distances from source nodes
  // `rep` is the construct for state transformation (remember the round-by-round loop behaviour)
  // `mux` is a purely functional multiplexer (selects the first or second branch according to condition)
  // `foldhoodPlus` folds over the neighbourhood (think like Scala's fold)
  // (`Plus` means "without self"--with plain `foldhood`, the device itself is folded)
  // `nbr(e)` denotes the values to be locally computed and shared with neighbours
  // `nbrRange` is a sensor that, when folding, returns the distance wrt each neighbour
  def gradient(source: Boolean): Double =
    rep(Double.PositiveInfinity){ distance =>
      mux(source) { 0.0 } {
        foldhoodPlus(Double.PositiveInfinity)(Math.min)(nbr{distance}+nbrRange)
      }
    }

  // A custom local sensor
  def isSource = sense[Boolean]("source")
  // A custom "neighbouring sensor"
  def nbrRange = nbrvar[Double](NBR_RANGE_NAME)
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Step 2-3:** Use the ScaFi internal simulator to run the program on a predefined network of devices.

{% highlight scala %}
import it.unibo.scafi.simulation.gui.{Launcher, Settings}

object SimulationRunner extends Launcher {
  Settings.Sim_ProgramClass = "experiments.MyAggregateProgram"
  Settings.ShowConfigPanel = true
  launch()
}
{% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, you can use the approach taken in <a href="#building-aggregate-systems">Building Aggregate Systems</a>.
Indeed, an `AggregateSystem` object can be seen as a function from `Context` to `Export`:
you give a certain context, and get some export. The export must be passed to neighbours so that they can build their own context
and re-interpret the aggregate program.

**Step 2-4:** After a simple infestigation, you may want to switch to a more sophisticated simulator, like Alchemist.
Take a look at <a href="#Alchemist-simulator">Alchemist simulator</a>
for details about the use of ScaFi within Alchemist.

## ScaFi Architecture

From a deployment perspective, ScaFi consists of the following modules:

* **`scafi-commons`**: provides basic entities (e.g., spatial and temporal abstractions)
* **`scafi-core`**: represents the core of the project and provides an implementation of the ScaFi aggregate programming DSL,
  together with its standard library
* **`scafi-simulator`**: provides a basic support for simulating aggregate systems
* **`scafi-simulator-gui`**: provides a GUI for visualising simulations of aggregate systems
* **`spala`**: provides an actor-based aggregate computing middleware
* **`scafi-distributed`**: ScaFi integration-layer for `spala`

The modules to be imported (e.g., via sbt or Gradle) depend on the use case:

* _Development of a real-world aggregate application_.
  Bring `scafi-core` in for a fine-grained integration. For more straightforward distributed system setup, take a look at `scafi-distributed`.
* _Play, exercise, and experiment with aggregate programming_.
  Bring `scafi-core` in for writing aggregate programs as well as `scafi-simulator-gui` to quickly render an executing system.
* _Set up sophisticated simulations_
  Bring `scafi-core` in for writing aggregate programs
  and either (A) leverage the basic machinery provided by `scafi-simulator`,
  or (B) leverage the ScaFi support provided by Alchemist.

## Aggregate Programming

Here, we explain the basic constructs of the field calculus,
which are the core of the aggregate programming paradigm.
By combining these constructs, higher-level functions can be defined
to capture increasingly complex collective behaviour.

Consider the `Constructs` trait.

{% highlight scala %}
trait Constructs {
  def rep[A](init: => A)(fun: A => A): A
  def nbr[A](expr: => A): A
  def foldhood[A](init: => A)(acc: (A, A) => A)(expr: => A): A
  def aggregate[A](f: => A): A

  // the following (aggregate IF construct) can be defined upon AGGREGATE()
  def branch[A](cond: => Boolean)(th: => A)(el: => A)
  // the following is a variant of REP()
  def share[A](init: => A)(fun: (A, () => A) => A): A

  def mid: ID
  def sense[A](sensorName: String): A
  def nbrvar[A](name: NSNS): A
}
{% endhighlight %}

TBD

## ScaFi Standard Library

The ScaFi standard library is currently organised into the following modules:

* **`FieldUtils`**: define functionality to simplify aggregation of values from neighbours,
  accessible through two objects `includingSelf` or `excludingSelf` with obvious semantics:
  `sumHood(e)`, `unionHood(e)`, `unionHoodSet(e)`, `mergeHood(e)(overwritePolicy)`, `anyHood(e)`, `everyHood(e)`
* **`Gradients`**: defines gradient functions, such as: `classicGradient(src,metric)`
* **`BlockG`**: defines the gradient-cast (**`G`**) building block for propagating information, and related functionality such as: `distanceTo(src,metric)`, `broadcast(src,x,metric)`,
  `channel(src,target,width)`,
  * **`BlockC`**: defines the converge-cast (**`C`**) building block for collecting information along a spanning tree
* **`BlockS`**: defines the sparce-choice (**`s`**) building block for leader election
* **`BlocksWithGC`**: defines functionality that leverage `C` and `G`, such as: `summarize(sink,acc,local,Null)`, `average(sink,x)`
* **`StateManagement`**: provides utility functions over `rep`, such as:
  `roundCounter()`, `remember(x)`, `delay(x)`, `captureChange(x,initially)`, `countChanges(x,initially)`, `goesUp(x)`, `goesDown(x)`
* **`TimeUtils`**: provides time-related functionality, such as: `T(init,floor,decay)` and variants, `timer(length)`, `limitedMemory(x,y,timeout)`,
  `clock(len,dcay)`, `sharedTimeWithDecay(period,dt)`, `cyclicTimerWithDacay(len,decay)`
* **`CustomSpawn`**: provides support for aggregate processes through `spawn` function

To use a library component, just mix in your aggregate program class using keyword `with`:

```scala
class MyProgram extends AggregateProgram with BlockG with BlockS { /*...*/ }
```

Parts of the ScaFi library are described in the following papers:

<div class="bibtex_display" bibtexkey="Casadei2016mass|casadei2018agere|casadei2018scp"></div>

TBD

### Basic API

TBD

#### Field-operation utilities

#### Gradients

#### Gradient-cast (G)

#### Collect-cast (C)

#### Time-decay (T)

#### Leader election (S)

Block `S` (Sparse-choice) is used to perform decentralised leader election on a spatial basis.

```scala
val leader = S(grain = 10, metric = () => 1)
```

The previous snippet is used to elect leaders with a mean distance of 10 hops between two leaders.
The output is a boolean field that is true in correspondence of devices that are currently leader.


### Process API

For an introduction to the **aggregate process** concept and its API, consider reading the following paper:

<div class="bibtex_display" bibtexkey="casadei19processes"></div>

TBD

### Domain-specific APIs

TBD

#### Flocking

#### Crowd management

## Simulating Aggregate Systems

Simulation of aggregate systems
 involves the following:

1. _Defining the structure of an aggregate system_: in terms of devices (including their sensors and actuators),
  connectivity between devices (neighbouring relationship),
  and the environment in which devices are situated.
2. _Defining the behaviour of an aggregate system_:
  through an aggregate program expressed in the ScaFi DSL.
3. _Defining the simulation setup_: including simulation parameters,
  data to be exported,
  environment dynamics,
  and scheduling of computation rounds.

### ScaFi simulator

The ScaFi simulator consists of multiple modules:

* **`scafi-simulator`**: provides a basic support for simulating aggregate systems
* **`scafi-simulator-gui`**: provides a Swing GUI for visualising simulations of aggregate systems
* **`scafi-simulator-gui-new`**: provides a JavaFX GUI for visualising simulations of aggregate systems
* NOTE: there is also on-going work for adding support to 3D simulations, see [PR#38](https://github.com/scafi/scafi/pull/38)

#### ScaFi simulator engine

The ScaFi simulator engine is quite basic.

The idea for its usage is to leverage a factory, object `simulatorFactory`,
 to build a simulation `NETWORK` object,
 upon which various
 `exec` methods are available for scheduling computation rounds on the devices.
On a network, there are also methods like `addSensor` and `chgSensorValue`
 for programming the sensors of devices.

 Consider the following example:

```scala
object DemoSequenceLauncher extends App {

  val net = simulatorFactory.gridLike(GridSettings(6, 4, stepx = 1, stepy = 1), rng = 1.1)

  net.addSensor(name = "sensor", value = 0)
  net.chgSensorValue(name = "sensor", ids = Set(1), value = 1)
  net.addSensor(name = "source", value = false)
  net.chgSensorValue(name = "source", ids = Set(3), value = true)
  net.addSensor(name = "sensor2", value = 0)
  net.chgSensorValue(name = "sensor2", ids = Set(98), value = 1)
  net.addSensor(name = "obstacle", value = false)
  net.chgSensorValue(name = "obstacle", ids = Set(44,45,46,54,55,56,64,65,66), value = true)
  net.addSensor(name = "label", value = "no")
  net.chgSensorValue(name = "label", ids = Set(1), value = "go")

  var v = java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis()

  net.executeMany(
    node = DemoSequence,//new HopGradient("source"),
    size = 1000000,
    action = (n,i) => {
      if (i % 1000 == 0) {
        println(net)
        val newv = java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis()
        println(newv-v)
        println(net.context(4))
        v=newv
      }
    })
}
```

#### Graphical simulator

For the usage of the graphical simulator, consider the following example:

{% highlight scala %}
package experiments

import it.unibo.scafi.incarnations.BasicSimulationIncarnation.AggregateProgram

object MyAggregateProgram extends AggregateProgram {

  override def main() = gradient(isSource)

  def gradient(source: Boolean): Double =
    rep(Double.PositiveInfinity){ distance =>
      mux(source) { 0.0 } {
        foldhood(Double.PositiveInfinity)(Math.min)(nbr{distance}+nbrRange)
      }
    }

  def isSource = sense[Boolean]("source")
  def nbrRange = nbrvar[Double](NBR_RANGE_NAME)
}

import it.unibo.scafi.simulation.gui.{Launcher, Settings}

object SimulationRunner extends Launcher {
  Settings.Sim_ProgramClass = "experiments.MyAggregateProgram"
  Settings.ShowConfigPanel = true
  launch()
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Alchemist simulator

* Consider the following skeleton repository: [https://github.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist](https://github.com/scafi/learning-scafi-alchemist)
* Take a look at [this tutorial for ScaFi-Alchemist by G. Audrito](https://bitbucket.org/gaudrito/alchemist-example)

The ScaFi specific part in an Alchemist simulation descriptor is as follows:

```yaml
incarnation: scafi

pools:
  - pool: &program
      - time-distribution: 1
        type: Event
        actions:
          - type: RunScafiProgram
            parameters: [it.unibo.casestudy.MyProgram, 5.0]
            # 1st argument is the fully-qualified classname of your program (class extending AggregateProgram)
            # 2nd argument is retention time (i.e., amount of simulated time for which exports by neighbours are kept)
      - program: send # this is needed for broadcasting export to neighbours after program execution
```

**NOTE:** the `send` program is needed, otherwise there would be no communication among devices,
 preventing the unfolding of the aggregate logic.

**NOTE:** the ScaFi incarnation does not attempt to create defaults for undeclared molecules.
So, you need to declare all your molecules (including **exports**--otherwise, the exporter component will try to export a yet-to-be-created molecule) before accessing them (e.g., be sure to perform a `node.put()` before a corresponding `node.get()`), or the following error might occur **`The molecule does not exist and cannot create empty concentration`**.

A full Alchemist simulation descriptor is as follows (node: refer to the [Alchemist Documentation](https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/) for more up-to-date information):

```yaml
variables:
  random: &random
    min: 0
    max: 29
    step: 1
    default: 2

export:
  - time

seeds:
  scenario: *random
  simulation: *random

incarnation: scafi

environment:
  type: Continuous2DEnvironment
  parameters: []

network-model:
  type: ConnectWithinDistance #*connectionType
  parameters: [*range]

pools:
  - pool: &program
      - time-distribution:
          type: ExponentialTime
          parameters: [1]
        type: Event
        actions:
          - type: RunScafiProgram
            parameters: [it.unibo.casestudy.MyProgram, 5.0]
      - program: send
  - pool: &move
      - time-distribution: 1
        type: Event
        actions: []

displacements:
  - in:
      type: Grid
      parameters: [0, 0, 200, 80, 10, 10, 1, 1]
    programs:
      - *move
      - *program
    contents:
      - molecule: test
        concentration: true
```


## Building Aggregate Systems

The major challenge in building aggregate systems is dealing with distribution.

Executing individual computational rounds is very easy, as demonstrated by the following snippet (**standalone setup**):

{% highlight scala %}
import it.unibo.scafi.incarnations.BasicAbstractIncarnation

object MyIncarnation extends BasicAbstractIncarnation

import MyIncarnation._

class BasicUsageProgram extends AggregateProgram  {
  override def main(): Any = rep(0)(_ + 1)
}

object BasicUsage extends App {
  val program = new BasicUsageProgram()
  val c1 = factory.context(selfId = 0, exports = Map(), lsens = Map(), nbsens = Map())
  val e1 = program.round(c1)

  val c2 = factory.context(0, Map(0 -> e1))
  val e2 = program.round(c2)

  println(s"c1=$c1\ne1=$e1\n\nc2=$c2\ne2=$e2")
}
{% endhighlight %}

The following activites must be implemented

- execution of a reactive or temporally-delayed loop for executing computation rounds
- discovery of neighbours, and corresponding send and reception of exports from neighbours
- de/serialisation of exports (definition of the format, and transparent de/serialisation)
- implementation of a logical neighbouring relationship
- using a time window for retention of exports which also takes into account failure in export delivery
- implementation of an interface to sensors and actuators

Many of such activities are application- and deployment-specific, so it is not easy to come up with a general middleware solution.
However, we are working on it.

Take a look at the following paper for middleware- and deployment-level considerations:
